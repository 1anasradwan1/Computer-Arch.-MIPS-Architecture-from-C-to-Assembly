> A simulation of a basic MIPS CPU showcasing datapath and control logic.

---

## 📚 Overview
This project simulates a simplified **MIPS processor**, highlighting:
- Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute
- ALU Operations
- Register File & Memory
- Control Unit functionality

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the **structure** of a basic MIPS processor.
- Execute MIPS instructions in a simulated environment.
- Practice hardware-level thinking and logic design.

## ⚙️ Components
| Component      | Description                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ALU            | Handles arithmetic and logic operations      |
| Register File  | Stores data in 32-bit registers              |
| Control Unit   | Generates signals for operation flow         |
| Data Memory    | For load/store instructions                  |
